2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell design_1_i/util_vector_logic_0/Res[0]_INST_0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/RST. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks pix_clk_design_1_clk_wiz_0_1 and pix_clk_design_1_clk_wiz_0_1_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks pix_clk_design_1_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks pix_clk_design_1_clk_wiz_0_1_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks pix_clk_design_1_clk_wiz_0_1_1 and pix_clk_design_1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks pix_clk_design_1_clk_wiz_0_1_1] -to [get_clocks pix_clk_design_1_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>
